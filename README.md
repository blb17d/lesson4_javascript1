### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned how to use chrome developer tools that allow someone to be able to highlight a certain piece of a website and see it highlighted in the code so that the developer can test out different code and directly see its effects.
2. I learned about Javascript which allows for a more complicated and interactive webstie design. It allows for effects such as a scrolling webpage for example. 
3. I learned about variables which help save data. These are case sensitive containers that will store all the data you want to save.
